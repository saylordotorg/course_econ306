title: "ECON306: Industrial Organization"
course_description: "An exploration of market structure analysis and the strategic behaviors of competing firms in different market settings with equal emphasis on theory and empirical studies. Topics include strategies of competitive and cooperative behaviors, firm decisions in regulated environments and the likely effects of deregulation, and a game-theoretic approach."

**Unit 2: MARKET STRUCTURES AND WELFARE MEASURES** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this section, we will review different market structures and their
characteristics.  At this point in the course, it is important to recall
how firms set their prices under each market structure in order analyze
the degree of market power that they wield in different kinds of
markets.  We will also study Industrial Concentration, its causes, and
its consequences, as well as learn about the index used to measure the
level of concentration in an industry. *

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
 ·        Describe and calculate the profit maximizing behavior of
firms.  
 ·        Describe and explain the characteristics of a perfectly
competitive firm.  
 ·        Identify a perfectly competitive firm's short-run and long-run
shut down decisions.  
 ·        Define Quasi-rents and distinguish it from economic profits.  
 ·        Describe a competitive firm's supply curve, the market supply
curve and the market equilibrium.  
 ·        Define, graphically identify, and calculate the following:
Consumers surplus, willingness to pay, producers surplus, and the total
surplus.  
 ·        Define Pareto Optimality and identify conditions that lead to
a pareto optimal situation.  
 ·        Analyze the problems associated with assessing efficiency on
the basis of changes in total surplus.  
 ·        Define "market power", analyze what gives rise to market
power, and  distinguish between supply side substitution and demand side
substitution.  
 ·        Analyze the characteristics that constitute a monopoly
especially with respect to pricing, elasticity, and efficiency
concerns.  
 ·        Define product differentiation and the dimesions along which
products may differ.  
 ·        Describe the forces that may promote the increase or decrease
of product differentiation.  
 ·        Define Oligopoly and analyze the characteristics that
constitute an oligopoly.  
 ·        Explain the meaning of collusion and identify different kinds
of collusion and their consequences.  
 ·        Analyze the measurement and determinants of a firms market
power.  
 ·        Derive the Lerner index, explain its components and analyze
its relationship with the elasticity of demand.  
 ·        Analyze how the inefficiency related to market power depends
upon the time frame.  
 ·        Describe the factors that determine the size of dead-weight
loss.
