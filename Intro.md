This course surveys major topics and theories in the field of Industrial
Organization.  As part of the applied microeconomics structure,
Industrial Organization uses the basic tools of microeconomic theory and
game theory to study the structure and behavior of firms and their
strategic interactions with one another in the marketplace.  Industrial
Organization also studies the impact that those interactions have on
market structure and welfare. Different kinds of market structures
(perfect competition, imperfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, and so
forth) present different scenarios in which firms strive to acquire and
use market power for their strategic advantage.  While perfect
competition and monopoly are two market structures on opposite ends of
the spectrum, imperfect competition—where a limited number of firms
attempt to manipulate their rivals or consumers—is a more realistic
set-up.  This course will emphasize market structure analysis and the
strategic behaviors of competing firms, including (but not limited to)
product differentiation, collusion, price discrimination, pricing
strategy, non-price discrimination (i.e. advertising), horizontal
mergers, vertical integration, and vertical restraints. Industrial
Organization also examines the public policies that affect the structure
of markets and the behavior of firms.  The government’s role as a
regulator, working to prevent monopolization and restraint of trade, has
been a constant topic of study in and of itself.  Although this course
will introduce Antitrust Laws in the above context, it will not delve
into the regulatory implications or the welfare analyses of firms'
strategic behaviors, as those subjects belong to more advanced
Industrial Organization modules.  By the end of this course, you will be
able to understand, analyze, and evaluate the basic theoretical models
that define the behavior of firms and industrial organization more
generally.  You will also learn the game theory approach to some of
these models.  While emphasizing theory, the lessons in this course will
include empirical studies that will provide you with a deeper
understanding of the topic.  This should enable you to apply the theory
you have learned to real world examples. This course requires you to
have completed the Principles of Microeconomics course and Calculus I. 
You should also have a basic understanding of game theory prior to
enrolling in this course.

### Learning Outcomes

    strategic behavior of firms in the market.
-   Determine the factors that influence the firm’s decision-making over
    time.
