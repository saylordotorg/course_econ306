title: "ECON306: Industrial Organization"
course_description: "An exploration of market structure analysis and the strategic behaviors of competing firms in different market settings with equal emphasis on theory and empirical studies. Topics include strategies of competitive and cooperative behaviors, firm decisions in regulated environments and the likely effects of deregulation, and a game-theoretic approach."

**Unit 6: Business Practices: Strategies and Conduct** <span

*Competitive models tend to assume that consumers and competitors have
perfect information about every firm’s single price.   In reality,
however, markets deviate substantially from this scenario and indulge in
all kinds of strategic behavior that makes such information ambiguous.  
This behavior enables a firm, for example, to price-discriminate to its
advantage; they may charge different prices for the same product either
across firms (e.g. segmenting markets by geographic location) or to
different customers of the same firm (e.g. airline tickets are cheaper
for those who include a Saturday stay).  Other strategies may include
indulging in non-price discrimination or engaging in research and
development to have an edge on rivals as well as merging horizontally or
integrating vertically.  We will study the impact that such behaviors
have on other firms in the market.  *

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Learning Outcomes:  
 Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
 ·        Define strategic behavior and identify the four elements
pointed out by Thomas Schelling that are required for a move or a action
to be strategic.  
 ·        Distinguish between strategic and tactical choices.  
 ·        Analyze the factors that influence the strategic behaviors of
firms in the short run, the long run, and the very long run.  
 ·        Solve  (mathematically, as well as graphically,) the extensive
form of Stackelberg game by calculating the optimal response function of
each player, and finding the subgame perfect nash equilibrium.  
 ·        Identify the first mover advantage in the Stackelberg game.  
 ·        Compare the results and the efficiency features of the
Stackelberg equilibrium and the Cournot equilibrium.  
 ·        Analyze the role of commitment in the Stackelberg model.  
 ·        Define what is meant by limit output and its role in
preventing entry of a new firm when the firm has contant returns to
scale and economies of scale.  
 ·        Analyze how firms use predatory pricing as strategic
behavior.  
 ·        Analyze how investments and sunk expenditures of an incumbent
firm provides a cost advantage to it and deters entry of new firms and
the antitrust ramifications of such behavior.  
 ·        Define entry barriers and distinguish it from entry
deterrence.  
 ·        Derive the best response functions in a game-theoretic
model.  
 ·        Algebraically and numerically solve a two-stage model with
strategic complements and strategic substitutes.  
 ·        Define what is meant by strategic accommodation.  
 ·        Define what is meant by learning-by-doing.  
 ·        Define and identify switching costs.  
 ·        Distinguish between cooperative advertising and predatory
advertising..  
 ·        Discuss the use of advertising as an instrument to deter
entry.  
 ·        Analyze the various effects of Research and Development
activities undertaken by firms.  
 ·        Define the terms "replacement effect" and "efficiency
effect."  
 ·        Analyze how governments use trade policy as instruments of
strategic commitment.  
 ·        Define the different types of mergers that firms engage in.  
 ·        Analyze the vertical relations and vertical restraints among
firms.  
 ·        Explain the effects of resale price maintenance.  
 ·        Analyze why firms engage in tying or bundling of two or more
products.  
 ·        Explain how managerial incentives and delelgation are
important concepts in  strategic competition.
