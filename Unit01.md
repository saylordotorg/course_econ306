**Unit 1: The Field of Industrial Organization** <span id="1"></span> 
*The most basic questions that concern the field of Industrial
Organization are: How do firms acquire market power?  How do firms use
market power?  What are the implications of market power?  And can
public policy limit unrelenting growth of market power?  This section of
the course will address the systematic frameworks in which the theory of
markets and the behavior of firms can be studied.  *

**1.2.1 The Structure-Conduct-Performance Paradigm** <span
id="1.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This is the traditional approach to studying Industrial
Organization.  This approach dominated the field from the 1940s to the
1960s, but by the early '70s, a new approach, called the "new industrial
economics," gained popularity.  While the former approach was more
empirical and linked common elements of market structure observed across
industries to their conduct and performance, the latter approach
emanated based on the need to develop and test theoretical models of
firm conduct.  *
