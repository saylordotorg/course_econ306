**Unit 4: Monopoly** <span id="4"></span> 
*A market with a single seller of a product or service has an obvious
advantage in pricing, thus posing a persistent threat to desirable
competitive outcomes.  In this unit, we will identify the possible
sources of market power, including scale economies and network
organization, both of which are advantageous to a firm seeking to
establish monopoly.  Entry barriers also foster monopoly by keeping
potential competitors out, while patents enable firms to enjoy exclusive
rights as a reward for the discovery of an idea and can often result in
monopoly as well.  After discussing the sources of monopoly, we will
study monopolistic pricing strategies. *  
  
 *Our study of price discrimination in a single product monopoly context
will shed light on how monopolists can charge one consumer one price and
another consumer another price, even though the cost of producing the
good or serving the consumer remains the same.*  
  
 *We will then take a look at instances where a multi-product firm has
monopoly in one product; in these situations, the consumer might be
forced to buy another product (or products), because the firm has tied
it to the monopolized one.  For example, when selling a camera, the
buyer has to agree to pay for the film as well.  Another way for a
multiproduct firm to offer its monopolized good is by bundling them
together.  Microsoft, for example, bundled Internet Explorer with the
Windows Operating System, although the internet browser did not appear
to generate revenues directly, because it was bundled at no extra cost. 
However, Microsoft did achieve its goal of establishing a strong
position for itself in the browser market.  It was later penalized for
this action on the grounds of violating antitrust laws.*
