**Unit 5: Models of Oligopoly** <span id="5"></span> 
*The behavior of firms in oligopoly continues to pique the interest of
researchers, scholars, and students alike, who have generated numerous
models to study the strategy of firms and their competitors in
oligopolistic competition.  Please note that different models apply to
different situations; in this regard, no one model can be deemed
“better” than the other.  This section will introduce you to some of the
first models of oligopoly that were built using the tools of
noncooperative game theory.  The Cournot and Bertrand models presented
here are known as static games of complete information, while the
Stackelberg model belongs to the category of dynamic games.  Static and
dynamic games are explained below.*  
  
 *A note on Game Theory: Game theory involves the process of strategic
decision-making.   A game theoretic situation arises when the payoffs
(profits) arising from the optimal choice made by a firm (or any agent)
depends on the actions taken by others.  This is also called "payoff
interdependency."   If the agent recognizes this interdependent
decision-making, his optimal choice will be based on his expectations
about the choices that others playing the "game” will make.*  *"Static
games" are simultaneous move games in which each player moves once, not
knowing the action of his or her rivals.  These games are sometimes also
called "strategic games."   In a "dynamic game," players move
sequentially with some knowledge of the actions taken by others*.  *Such
games are often called "extensive games*."  
  
 *Both static and dynamic games can also be distinguished in terms of
the level of certainty or uncertainty of rivals' actions.   With perfect
information, all of the players know the entire history of the game when
it is their turn to move, whereas in games of imperfect information, at
least some of the players have only partial knowledge of the history of
the game.   In games of complete information, everyone knows the payoffs
that each player receives when the game is over.   However, in games of
incomplete information, players know their own payoffs but may not know
the ultimate payoffs of some of the other players.*

analysis is built.

theory.

game.  
 ·        Solve a "prisoner's dilemma" game.

that have a unique or multiple Nash equilibria.

games.
