title: "ECON306: Industrial Organization"

Topics include strategies of competitive and cooperative behaviors, firm decisions in regulated environments and the likely effects of deregulation, and a game-theoretic approach."

**Unit 8: The Role of Government** <span id="8"></span> 
*Regulation is required in situations where a firm has excessive market
power.   From a firm’s point of view, market power translates as greater
profits and greater firm value.   However, from the perspective of
consumers and policymakers, market power implies reduced social welfare,
as firms make consumers pay higher prices for their products and
services.  A high price can also lead to allocative inefficiency and
even productive inefficiency (i.e. when a firm with market power tries
to limit the supply of its good in order to keep its price high).  While
policymakers work to reduce these inefficiencies through regulation,
there are situations where imperfect markets may be preferable to
regulated outcomes*.  *Consider, for example, instances where the
government itself can be a cause of market power.  A firm interested in
establishing a monopolist situation might work to influence policymakers
by "rent seeking," resulting in wasteful side effects.*  
  
 *This section studies the regulation of large business firms and
corporations through antitrust laws.  It also discusses the regulation
of industries in which services are provided exclusively by privately
owned firms, but regulated by public agencies.  These firms are often
called "public utilities."   Lastly, this unit addresses the role that
the government plays in pointing out the potential problems that arise
due to regulation.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
 ·       Analyze why regulation can be important.  
 ·       Explain the role of government in the regulation of
competition, regulation of industries, and in social regulation.  
 ·       Analyze how governmentintervention can directlyaffect market
outcomes, such as prices, quality, product variety, or the number of
service providers,by changing market institutions.  
 ·       Analyze how government regulation can indirectly affect market
outcomes by changing or imposing constraintson market participants.  
 ·       Explain rationales for the existence of price and
entryregulation.  
 ·       Compare the public interest explanation for regulation
vis-à-vis the economic explanation of regulation.

 Note: Designing institutions for the purpose of regulation is not a
simple matter.  Traditional regulatory arrangements have by and large
proved to be unsatisfactory, often creating a great deal of economic
inefficiency and weakening firm incentives to innovate or control
costs.  As technologies and institutions change with time, so too does
the degree of regulation.  The current trend is to deregulate or rely
less on the regulation of entire industries wherever possible.  New
arrangements allow for partial regulation of industries, providing
competitive forces with more room to operate.*
