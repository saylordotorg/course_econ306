**Unit 3: Theory of the Firm** <span id="3"></span> 
*In order to understand the mechanics of Industrial Organization, you
must have a solid grasp of microeconomic concepts, especially that of
competitive markets.  We will therefore begin by reviewing some
principles of microeconomics.  Even if the material seems familiar, take
your time reviewing it to ensure you fully grasp the particulars of each
concept.    
 The first part of this section will focus on the neoclassical theory of
the firm that was taught in the principles course and introducing you to
some new concepts.  We will revisit marginal cost and average cost
functions, both in the short run as well as in the long run.  The course
will then present "Economies of Scale" in order to review the
relationship between long run average costs and output.  "Economies of
Scope," a concept that explains the existence of multiproduct firms,
will also be discussed.   Finally, we will learn about seller
concentration, which will likely be new to you.  
 The second part of this section will introduce an alternate theory of
the firm that was developed in order to counter the neoclassical theory
of firm behavior.  The neoclassical theory of firm behavior asserts that
the firm's existence is a paradox because optimal outcomes can be
costless and can be efficiently achieved through the price mechanism, or
the "invisible hand."   The Transaction Cost Approach to the Theory of
the Firm (attributed to Ronald Coase), on the other hand, contends that
there are costs involved in operating the market.  The firm itself is an
example of one of these costs.  Thus, in order to fully understand the
working of the economic system or establish sound economic policy, one
must account for so-called "transaction costs."  *

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
 ·       Explain the intuition behind costs functions.  
 ·       Define and calculate marginal and average cost functions, both
in the short run and in the long run, and describe the relationship
between the two.  
 ·       Relate the cost functions to the behavior of firms.   
 ·       Define  and calculate each of the following cost concepts:  
 o      Opportunity costs,  
 o      The economic costs of durable inputs,  
 o      Avoidable costs and sunk expenditures,  
 o      Short run versus the long run, and  
 o      Variable and fixed costs.  
 ·       Define economies of scale.  
 ·       Identify the conditions that lead to, or create economies of
scale.  
 ·       Define economies of scope.  
 ·       Define multiplant economies of scope.  
 ·       Distinguish between economies of scale, economies of scope, and
multiplant economies of scope.  
 ·       Explain the dynamics between economies of scale and seller
concentration.  
 ·       Describe the transaction cost approach to the  theory of the
firm, as created by Ronald Coase.  
 ·       Describe what is meant by transaction costs.  
 ·       Explain as in Ronald Coase's theory, the presence of market
transactions despite the existence of large firms who can reproduce the
conditions of a competitive market .  
 ·       Explain the Coase theorem.
