**Unit 7: Antitrust Markets** <span id="7"></span> 

*In this section, we will study the boundaries of a market that is
essential to antitrust enforcement.  The different definitions of
boundaries have different implications for market power, market share,
and firm conduct.  In order to ensure that the firms do not infringe
upon each other's rights or have unfair practices, a market needs to be
clearly defined.  Antitrust laws and competition policies define conduct
that create, enhance, or preserve market power.*

*            After studying the distinction between economic markets and
antitrust markets, we will analyze the the kind of markets that require
antitrust enforcement and then move on to the role of elasticity of
demand  in the two markets.*
